# Hardware Password Manager

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/S4_pITpOw2c
#### Description: Hardware password manager with isolated (output only) HID USB interface.Â 
- Store, index, and generate secure passwords and usernames for services
- More secure and convenient then writing login details down
- Plug in to a USB port, paste entries out through the keyboard emulation hardware
- Portable across systems and at boot time (BIOS passwords, hdd decryption...)
- More secure then online password managers

The keyboard emulator has only a receiving link to the password manager hardware. This ensures your stash of passwords and the password manager OS remain secure even when used on a compromised system (this doesn't prevent a threat from logging passwords that you paste out to the keyboard emulator on compromised systems).

Entries are encrypted on the device by a lock pin. You can create multiple logins. Optionally it allows creation of dummy users which adds some hardening to weaker pins. An adversary would have to break multiple pins as well as knowing which services to look for.

## Why use this 
- To setup access across multiple systems conveniently
- Be in direct control of your stash of credentials
 
## This does not
- Prevent key logging of credentials on comprised systems
